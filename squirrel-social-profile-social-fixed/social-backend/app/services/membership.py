"""Waitlist, referrals and founding badges.

Every account gets a `members` row the first time it calls the service: a place in the queue (in
the order people joined) and a referral code. Everyone is admitted straight away; the queue is
shown, not enforced. Members whose friends' accounts joined with their code — `referrals_to_skip`
of them, each with a verified email — "skip the line": they move ahead of everyone who has not.

Founding badges follow the order members proved their email address at sign-up (the Exercise
backend's `ev` token claim): the first `founding_first` get Founding Squirrel, the rest of the first
`founding_total` Founding 500. Accounts made before verification existed never count, so test
accounts cannot take the founding places.
