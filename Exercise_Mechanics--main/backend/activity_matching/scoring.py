"""Pure activity-matching rules: who may be paired, how well, and why.

    activities  60%  the best shared activity, weighted by BOTH members' interest (5 × 5 = full
                     marks), plus a little for sharing more than one
    level       20%  same fitness level = full, one step apart = half, two apart = none
    schedule    20%  any overlap in preferred workout times; left out (weights rescaled) unless both
                     members share their times

Pairing needs at least one shared activity and is symmetric: A is suggested to B exactly when B is
suggested to A, and both see the same score.
