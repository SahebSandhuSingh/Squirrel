-- db/queries/finalize-run.sql
--
-- SQL fragments for the run finalization worker (RM-3.2).
--
-- These are parameterised statements — never concatenate untrusted values.
-- Each statement is separated by a ---- sentinel comment and identified by
-- its KEY so finalize.ts can split and select them by index.
--
-- Statement order:
--   [0] SELECT_RUN_FOR_UPDATE   — lock the run row, read owner
--   [1] SELECT_POINTS           — load run_points ordered by seq
--   [2] UPDATE_STATUS           — set runs.status ($1=status, $2=run_id)
--   [3] INSERT_REJECTION        — insert run_rejections row
--   [4] INSERT_TERRITORY        — insert territories row
--
-- All statements are used inside a single transaction in finalize.ts.

----
-- [0] SELECT_RUN_FOR_UPDATE
-- Lock the run row for the duration of the transaction.
-- Returns fields needed for idempotency and the activity_session write.
SELECT user_id, status, started_at, distance_m, elapsed_time_s

----
-- [1] SELECT_POINTS
-- Load run_points in recording order, strictly by seq.

-- [2] UPDATE_STATUS
-- Set the run's status.  Called twice: once on rejection, once on success.

----
-- [4] INSERT_TERRITORY
-- Insert a new territory row.  All metric and geometry values come from the
-- server-side pipeline — never from a client-supplied parameter.
-- $1 = id (uuid, generated server-side)
-- $2 = owner_id (uuid, from runs.user_id — never a function parameter)
-- $3 = run_id (uuid)
-- $4 = geometry WKT (MULTIPOLYGON, EPSG:4326, from processTrack)
-- $5 = area_m2 (double precision, from ST_Union +' validateGeometry, NOT a face sum)
