# Assets

All artwork is original and made for Squirrel Social: neon nightlife over a sunset city.

**The app renders its art from code**, in the vector components in `src/art/` (react-native-svg). They stay crisp at any size, can be animated (mascot idle bob, route drawing), and take props: every avatar is built from an `AvatarLook`, and products take colours.

The PNGs here are **exports of those same components**, for the app icon and splash, store listings, marketing and a future backend or web CMS.

Scenes and illustrations are exported at 2× (e.g. mascot 800², scenes 800×1000).

To regenerate them after changing the art, render the components on a temporary web route and screenshot each one with Playwright (`omitBackground: true`).
