"""Workout Score: one 0–100 number per exercise in a session, with feedback, built only from what
pose detection and rep analysis captured. It is SYSTEM-GENERATED: nothing is asked of the user, no
profile data is used, and the member's own Activity Rating (backend/activity_rating/) never feeds it.

Every rep's form score is already technique × depth (engine/scorer.py: time_score × rom_factor).
The Workout Score keeps those two apart so depth is not counted twice and the feedback can say
which one cost the points:

    technique    40%  mean technique score: 100 minus the penalties from flagged faults
    depth        25%  mean depth reached, relative to the exercise's full-range gate
    completion   20%  reps done of reps planned
    consistency  15%  how steady form and tempo stayed from the first rep to the last

Timed exercises (high knees) use the same four parts from their set scores: form factor, lift
height, sets completed, and left/right balance.

A score needs at least MIN_REPS scored reps. If most reps were scored with incomplete tracking
the score is marked provisional: the report's own warning that a form percentage from a pose model
is only as fair as the camera view it came from.
