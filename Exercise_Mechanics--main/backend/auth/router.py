"""Auth REST routes.

  • POST /api/auth/email-code — email a 6-digit sign-up code (auth/email_codes.py).
  • POST /api/auth/register — create an account (email + code + password + name) and sign in.
  • POST /api/auth/login    — exchange email + password for tokens.
  • POST /api/auth/refresh  — rotate a refresh token into a fresh token pair.
  • POST /api/auth/email/start  — email a 6-digit code to sign in, or to join (no password).
  • POST /api/auth/email/verify — exchange that code for tokens; a new address becomes an account
    (it needs a name). Code-only accounts have no usable password.
  • GET  /api/auth/jwks.json   — the RS256 public key as a JWK set (empty while tokens are HS256),
    for services that verify tokens by JWKS URL (the Social service's SOCIAL_JWKS_URL).

All are rate-limited (auth/throttle.py): 429 with Retry-After when over a limit. Sign-up is open to
the allowed email domains only (config.allowed_email_domains: any .ac.in address by default), and needs
the emailed code while config.email_verification_required() is on.
