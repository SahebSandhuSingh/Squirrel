"""Sign-up email verification: a 6-digit code sent to the address, required to create the account.

    POST /api/auth/email-code {email}   → the address's domain is checked, a code is emailed
    POST /api/auth/register {…, code}   → the code is checked (and used up) before the account exists

So every account made while verification is on (config.email_verification_required) has proved it
owns its address; its access tokens carry `"ev": true` (auth/tokens.py), which the Social service
reads for the founding-member badges.

    a code lives           10 minutes
    wrong guesses          5, then the code is dead and a new one must be requested
    a new code             at most one every 30 seconds per address,
                           5 an hour per address, 30 an hour per caller address (auth/throttle.py)

Storage mirrors the rest of auth: the email_verification_codes table with DATABASE_URL (migration
004), else files under config.AUTH_DIR/email_codes. Emails are keyed by their SHA-256; codes are
kept only as an HMAC with the signing secret.
