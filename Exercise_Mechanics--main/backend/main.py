"""FitSync backend — restructured app.

The previous monolith is preserved as backend_old/ (reference only). The one-time A-pose
calibration has been dropped in favour of a per-set pre-check baseline (built in the engine/
and training/ layers). Today this serves the built SPA, user/session REST surfaces and the current
setup/training sockets; scoring, reporting and exercise breadth migrate in their own stages.

Layout:
    config.py    settings + per-user storage paths
    core/        generic primitives (landmarks, ids, keypoint helpers)
    engine/      exercise-agnostic infra (loader, scoring) — no rules, no FSM
    sessions/    minimal atomic session identity + plan persistence
    workouts/    validated lifecycle catalog + per-exercise config/FSM/rules
    training/    live setup-flow WS (/ws/setup) + baseline capture orchestration
    users/       user REST (create · profile · skill)
    profiles/    sign-up details: age, gender, activities, measurements/BMI, physique, habits, consent
    partners/    Partner Hunt: preferences, matching, blocks, behind the Run Module's XP gate
    activity_matching/  workout partners suggested by shared activities (opt-in, no XP gate)
    activity_rating/    the member's own rating of a session (user-generated; never feeds the Workout Score)
    moderation/         reports on members or sessions, and the moderators' review queue
    db/                 optional PostgreSQL mirror of exercise sessions (DATABASE_URL)
    auth/               Squirrel Social accounts (register · login · refresh) + bearer-token dependency
    nearby/             BLE nearby discovery: rotating ids, proximity scoring, nearby list, notifications
    deeplinks/          /join + /invite/{token} store routing, download QR, Universal/App Link files

Run from the project root:
    uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
