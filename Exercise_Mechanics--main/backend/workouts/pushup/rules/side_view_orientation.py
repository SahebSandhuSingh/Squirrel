"""Side-on camera check — the rule that makes the push-up's camera requirement enforced, not assumed.

Every push-up measurement (depth and body line alike) is only valid in the sagittal plane, so this
kernel answers one question from a single frame's shoulders + hips: IS THE CAMERA SEEING THIS BODY
FROM THE SIDE?

THE MEASUREMENT — shoulder and hip spread, normalized by torso length:

    spread = max(|x_left_shoulder - x_right_shoulder|, |x_left_hip - x_right_hip|) / torso_length

    Seen from the side, the left and right shoulders sit almost on top of each other in the image
    (they are separated along the camera axis, not across it), so the ratio is small — around 0.10 in
    practice. Seen front-on, the same separation is close to full shoulder width and the ratio is
    several times larger. Dividing by torso length (shoulder midpoint to hip midpoint) makes the
    reading independent of how far the user stands from the camera, and taking the worse of the two
    ratios means a user who has squared their shoulders OR their hips is caught either way.

    This holds for a push-up specifically, even though the torso is horizontal: the
    shoulder-to-shoulder axis still points toward the camera in profile, which is what the ratio
    measures.

WHY IT IS A MONITOR, NOT A PENALTY: a front-on camera is not a fault in the user's form — it means
the measurements cannot be trusted. It therefore cues the user ("turn your side to the camera") and
contributes nothing to any score. It is also the one template active in all three contexts and in
every phase: the camera angle has to be right before the set starts AND stay right, because a user
rotating a few degrees between reps silently corrupts both live signals.

FRAME HYSTERESIS: the raw band is debounced over consecutive frames (`confirm_frames` to raise,
`clear_frames` to clear) so a single noisy frame neither tells a correctly placed user to reposition
nor clears a genuinely front-on setup. Hysteresis is switched OFF for the setup adapter, which needs
an immediate per-frame verdict because the setup flow applies its own `stable_ms` dwell on top.

Ported from the standalone service's orientation check
(pose_backend/validation.py: check_orientation + FrameValidator hysteresis). Two separate constants
there (0.38 shoulders, 0.34 hips) are consolidated into one range table here; see templates.yaml for
why that is deliberate.
