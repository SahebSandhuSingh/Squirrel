# Squirrel Social — Profile + Social service

FastAPI + PostgreSQL service that owns **profiles, follows, posts, likes, saves, comments,
badges and activity summaries** for the mobile app (`../mobile`). Routes live under `/v1`, next
to the Run Module's, so both can sit behind one gateway.

It does **not** own runs, XP or authentication:

| Concern | Owner | How Social uses it |
|---|---|---|
| Sign-in / tokens | Account service (RS256 JWT) | Verifies the same bearer token as the Run Module; `sub` identifies the account |
| Runs, GPS, territory | Run Module | Reads `GET /v1/runs/:id` **with the caller's token** when a run is shared; keeps distance + time only |
| XP | Run Module | Your own: `GET /v1/users/me/xp` with your token on every profile read. Everyone else's: a read cache (`user_stats.xp`) refreshed in one `POST /internal/v1/xp/totals` call (service token) when older than `SOCIAL_XP_CACHE_TTL_S`, while a list shows them; never incremented here, and the last figure is shown if the Run Module is down (`app/services/xp_cache.py`, ADR-032) |
| Form-coach workouts | Exercise backend | Can publish finished sessions via `POST /internal/v1/activities` (service token) |

### Tables (migration `0001_profile_social`)

| Table | Key / constraints | Indexes | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `users` | PK `id` (public UUID); unique `auth_subject`, unique `username`; CHECK visibility, role | `(city_id, created_at)` | One profile per account. The JWT `sub` is stored but never returned. No email/password. |
| `user_stats` | PK/FK `user_id`; CHECK counters ≥ 0 | – | Followers/following/posts counters and cached Run Module XP, kept off the profile row |
| `follows` | PK `(follower_id, followee_id)`; CHECK not self; status `accepted`/`pending` | `(follower_id, status, created_at)`, `(followee_id, status, created_at)` | Follow graph; duplicates impossible; pending = request to a private account |
| `activities` | PK `id`; unique `(source, source_ref)`; CHECK type/source | `(user_id, started_at)` | Summary of a finished workout. `source_ref` = Run Module `run_id` / exercise session id, so one run can't become two activities. **No GPS.** |
| `media` | PK `id`; unique `storage_key` | `(owner_id, created_at)` | Uploaded photos (pending → ready) |
| `posts` | PK `id`; unique `activity_id` (one post per activity); FKs to activity/media | `(created_at, id)`, `(author_id, created_at, id)`, `(city_id, created_at, id)` | Normalised post; counters denormalised |
| `post_likes` | PK `(post_id, user_id)` | `(user_id, created_at)` | Likes |
| `post_saves` | PK `(user_id, post_id)` | `(user_id, created_at, post_id)` | Bookmarks (the profile's Saved tab) |
| `comments` | PK `id` | `(post_id, created_at, id)` | Comments |
| `badges` / `user_badges` | PK `id` / PK `(user_id, badge_id)` | – | Catalogue (seeded) + awards |

Counters (`likes_count`, `comments_count`, `followers_count`, …) only move in the same
transaction as the row that justifies them, and only when that row was actually inserted/deleted
(`INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING`), so double taps and concurrent requests can't skew
them. `tests/test_concurrency.py` hammers this on PostgreSQL.

### Privacy

- Never returned: auth subject, email, password, role, storage keys, GPS, route or territory geometry.
- Posts carry a **city id + area name** only. Shared runs keep distance and moving time.
- `visibility: private`: non-followers see name, avatar and counts only; posts, bio, city,
  college, interests, badges and follower lists are hidden (post URLs return 404). Follows become
  requests that the owner accepts. Switching back to public accepts pending requests.
- Internal ingestion refuses metric keys that look like location data (`lat`, `route`, …).
- Squirrel Dates is the one feature that looks at a route, and only for members who opted in: it
  reads the finished run's points from the Run Module's `run_points` (read-only, shared database)
  and keeps which named campus zone the run passed, on which local day and hour. No point, route or
  minute is stored; opting out deletes those rows, and they are pruned after 56 days.

### Performance

- Every list is **keyset-paginated** (`cursor` + `limit`, max 50), backed by the indexes above.
- A feed page is serialised in a **constant number of queries**: posts + authors + author stats
  + activities in one join, then one `IN (…)` query each for "liked by me", "saved by me",
  "following author" and media URLs. `test_feed_page_query_count_is_constant` enforces this.
- A profile screen needs **one request** (identity, stats, badges, 9 recent posts, 10 recent activities).
- Counts come from maintained counters, not from loading relationships.

## API contract

Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <RS256 JWT>` on every `/v1` route (401 + `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`
otherwise). Errors are `{ "detail": "<message>", "code": "<machine code>" }` (FastAPI's
validation 422 keeps its `detail: [...]` list). Timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC.

### Community (migration `0002_community`)

| Route | What |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/me/membership` · `POST /v1/me/referral {code}` | Waitlist place (everyone is admitted; 3 verified friends with your code move you to the front), invite code and link, founding badge (first 15 verified: Founding Squirrel, first 500: Founding 500; "verified" = the token's `ev` claim) |
| `GET /v1/community/config` | Hostels to pick from (`SOCIAL_HOSTELS`), founding and referral rules |
| `GET /v1/stats/daily?days=7` | Campus totals per local day (active members, runs, verified km, workouts) and mine today |
| `GET /v1/leaderboards/xp?window=daily\|weekly` | Top 10 by XP earned in the window (XP from the Run Module's `/v1/leaderboard/xp`), with names and hostels |
| `GET /v1/leaderboards/hostels?window=` | Hostel vs hostel: the XP of each hostel's members |
| `GET·POST /v1/crews`, `GET /v1/crews/{id}`, `POST …/join`, `DELETE …/membership`, `POST·DELETE …/members/{user}/vouch` | Crews, members since when, vouching between members |
| `GET·POST /v1/events`, `GET·DELETE /v1/events/{id}`, `POST·DELETE …/rsvp`, `POST …/checkin`, `POST /v1/checkins` | Events (open or for a crew, capacity, cancel), RSVPs, reminders an hour before, check-ins that tell up to 5 followers or crewmates |
| `GET·POST /v1/challenges`, `POST …/{id}/accept\|decline\|cancel` | Head-to-head: most verified km or most workouts in 1–30 days |
| `GET /v1/notifications`, `/unread-count`, `POST /v1/notifications/read` | The in-app list |
| `POST /v1/me/push-tokens`, `DELETE /v1/me/push-tokens/{token}` | Expo push tokens; pushes go through Expo's service after the request commits (`app/services/push.py`) |
| `POST /internal/v1/notifications` | Service token: `{ user_subject, kind, actor_subject?, title?, body?, actor_fallback?, data{}, dedupe_key }` → `{ created, notification_id }` (Social's id; a retry with the same `dedupe_key` returns the same id). **Run Module kinds** `territory_lost / territory_captured / territory_expired`: Social writes the text, so `title` / `body` must be left out. **Campus kinds** `territory.stolen / territory.challenged / territory.defended / zone.claimed / challenge.invitation / challenge.reminder / challenge.updated / event.reminder / meetup.check_in / meetup.invited / meetup.accepted / meetup.declined / meetup.cancelled / activity.verification_complete`: the caller sends `title` (required) and `body`, with `{actor}` where the actor's name goes; Social puts in the display name, or `actor_fallback` (default `Someone`) when there is no actor or Social doesn't know them. When the actor and the recipient are blocked either way, the notification never names them and drops `run_id`, `capture_event_id`, `user_id`, `actor_id` and `actor_subject` from `data`. A tap opens `data.route` when it is a path, otherwise one picked from the kind (`/meetup/{meetup_id}`, `/zone/{zone_id}`, `/invites`, `/events`, …) |
| `POST /internal/v1/tasks/event-reminders` | Service token: send due event reminders (a cron, while the free plan sleeps) |
| `POST /internal/v1/tasks/push-receipts` | Service token: `{ receipts_read }` — read the Expo receipts of pushes sent ≥15 min ago now (the service also does it every 5 min); failures are logged with Expo's reason and `DeviceNotRegistered` tokens disabled (a cron, while the free plan sleeps) |
| `POST /internal/v1/people/resolve` | Service token (campus-service): `{ subjects[]≤200, profile_ids[]≤200 }` → `{ people: [{ subject, profile_id, username, display_name, avatar_url, hostel, level }] }`; unseen subjects are provisioned, unknown profile ids omitted, each person once. The only place a subject↔profile mapping leaves Social |
| `GET /internal/v1/blocks/{subject}` | Service token (campus-service): `{ subject, blocked: [subject…], as_of }` — everyone blocked **either way** with that person. Never writes; an unseen subject has none. Callers cache ≤30 s and fail closed (ADR-032) |
| `POST /internal/v1/blocks/import` | Service token: `{ blocks: [{ blocker, blocked }]≤1000 }` (subjects) → `{ imported, already, skipped }`. One-time copy of another service's own block table; safe to re-run; provisions unseen subjects; removes follows between the two, like an app block |
| `POST /internal/v1/crews/memberships` | Service token (campus-service): `{ subjects[]≤200 }` → `{ people: [{ subject, crews: [{ id, name, role, joined_at }] }] }`, oldest membership first (the first is the main crew); request order, each subject once. Never writes; an unseen subject has no crews |
| `POST /internal/v1/crews/lookup` | Service token: `{ crew_ids[]≤200 }` → `{ crews: [{ id, name, interest, scope, hostel, members_count, members: [{ subject, role, joined_at }] }] }`; unknown ids are left out (never a 404) |
| `GET /internal/v1/crews/count` | Service token → `{ crews_total, as_of }`: crews with at least one member, counted from the membership rows (campus-service's stats) |

| GET / POST /v1/ambassador/application | Ambassador applications, settings, and rate-limited form submission. |
| GET /v1/admin/ambassador/applications / POST ./decision | Requires `admin` role: list pending/reviewed applications and approve/reject with notifications. |

**Moving existing blocks into Social (once):** `scripts/import_blocks.py` reads campus-service's `blocks` table (`--campus-db`) and/or a copy of the Exercise backend's `data/users/` folder (`--partner-hunt-dir`, Partner Hunt's `partner_blocks.json` files) and sends them to the import route. Dry run by default; `--apply` sends. The service token comes from `SOCIAL_INTERNAL_TOKEN` in the environment, never the command line. Safe to re-run.

Profiles also carry `hostel`, `stats.month_km / month_runs / month_workouts` (verified this month) and
`crews` (member since, vouches).

### Squirrel Dates and blocking (migration `0004_squirrel_dates`)

Suggestion only: a person, a named campus zone and a time. It never invites or notifies anyone. To
meet, the member plans an ordinary event (`POST /v1/events`), which the app opens pre-filled.

| Route | What |
|---|---|
| `GET·PUT /v1/dates/settings {enabled}` | Opt in or out; off by default. Opting in scans the member's runs of the last 28 days; opting out deletes their zone visits |
| `GET /v1/dates/suggestions[?user_id=]` | Up to 3 suggestions: `{available, enabled, reason, suggestions[{id, user, reason, zone{id,name}, suggested_time}]}`. `available` is false until zones are configured |
| `POST /v1/dates/suggestions/{id}/dismiss` | "Maybe later": that person isn't suggested to you for 30 days (`id` is their user id) |
| `GET·POST·DELETE /v1/users/{id}/block`, `GET /v1/users/me/blocks` | Block. It works both ways: never suggested to each other, follows removed, no new follows or challenges |

Rules (`app/services/dates.py`), all in both directions:
- both members opted in, neither blocked the other, and you didn't dismiss them in the last 30 days;
- both passed the same zone at least twice in the last 28 days, on runs the Run Module finalized.

The zone is the one you share most. The time is the next weekday and hour you both use it most
(else the busiest for either of you), between 6 AM and 9 PM and at least 2 hours ahead.

Zones are configuration, never user data: `SOCIAL_ZONES_FILE` (or inline `SOCIAL_ZONES`), a JSON
list of `{"id", "name", "polygon": [[lat, lng], …]}` or `{"id", "name", "center": [lat, lng],
"radius_m"}`. A run visits a zone when at least 2 of its points fall inside. Bad JSON stops the
service at start-up. Zone visits come from `run_points` when the Run Module publishes a finished run
(`POST /internal/v1/activities`, `source_ref` = run id). If that table isn't there, the run is
recorded without zones.

### Activity badges (migration `0005_activity_badges`)

Awarded automatically (`app/services/badges.py`) when a verified activity arrives
(`POST /internal/v1/activities`, or a finalized run shared to the feed), in the same transaction,
with a `badge` notification. Local times are `SOCIAL_COMMUNITY_TIMEZONE`.

| Badge (`id`) | Rule (defaults) |
|---|---|
| Early Bird (`early_bird`) | 5 verified activities that started from 04:00 to before 07:00 |
| Night Owl (`night_owl`) | 5 verified activities that started from 21:00 to before 04:00 (a 1 AM run is a late night, not an early start) |
| Park Regular (`park_regular`) | One named zone visited on 5 different days, on verified runs. Reads Squirrel Dates' zone visits, so it needs zones configured and the member opted in, and the days must fall within the 56 days visits are kept |

Unverified activities (manual, flagged runs) and meals don't count. Counts are read from the
`activities` and `zone_visits` rows, so a re-sent activity counts once; awarding is idempotent. A
failing rule is logged and skipped, never failing the ingest. The catalogue descriptions state the
defaults (Park Regular's says it needs Squirrel Dates on): change them too if you change a threshold.

`GET /v1/users/me/badges` lists every badge a member can work towards, with progress; founding
badges appear only once held. Badge ids are the app's, with underscores (`founding_squirrel`,
`first_run`…); migration `0006_badge_ids` moved the first, hyphenated ids and their awards.

### Exercise/Run → Activity → optional Post

1. The Run Module finalises a run (unchanged).
2. The app's run summary shows **Share to feed** only for runs the server `finalized` or
   `flagged`, and opens the composer with the `run_id`.
3. `POST /v1/posts { activity: { source: "run", run_id } }`: Social fetches the run with the
   user's own token (the Run Module only returns the caller's runs), refuses rejected or
   still-processing runs, and stores one `activities` row (`source=run_module`,
   `source_ref=run_id`, distance, moving time, `verified = status == finalized`).
4. Sharing again returns 409. Deleting the post keeps the activity, so it can be shared again
   and still counts toward streaks.

Other modules publish with `POST /internal/v1/activities`, and the user shares with
`{ source: "activity", activity_id }`. Nothing in the Social backend changes when a new
module starts publishing.

**Assumption (Run Module):** `GET /v1/runs/:id` only returns runs owned by the token's user.
This matches how the app already uses it, but it must be confirmed against the Run Module.

## Run it

```bash
cd social-backend
python3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# database (PostgreSQL)
createdb social                                   # or: psql -c 'CREATE DATABASE social'
export SOCIAL_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://USER:PASS@localhost:5432/social
.venv/bin/alembic upgrade head                    # run migrations

# local dev keys + a token (the account service doesn't exist yet)
.venv/bin/python scripts/dev_token.py init
export SOCIAL_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE=dev-keys/public.pem
.venv/bin/python scripts/dev_token.py token aanya # paste into the app: Sign in → "Developer: paste a backend token"

# serve
export SOCIAL_RUN_MODULE_URL=https://…            # optional: XP + run sharing
export SOCIAL_CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8081  # only for Expo web
.venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8100
```

Docker: `docker build -t squirrel-social . && docker run -p 8100:8100 --env-file .env squirrel-social`
(the image runs `alembic upgrade head` before starting).

### Tests

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q                                   # SQLite, via the real migrations
SOCIAL_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://USER:PASS@localhost:5432/social_test \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q                                 # same suite on PostgreSQL (+ concurrency test)
```

`TEST_DATABASE_URL` (the name campus-service and Exercise use) is **not** read here: set on its own,
it stops the run with an error rather than letting the suite quietly test SQLite.

The Run Module and object storage are replaced by in-process doubles in tests. Everything else
is the real code path: HTTP, JWT verification, SQL and migrations.
