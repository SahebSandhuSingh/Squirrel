"""Partner Hunt Connect: ask someone on your board to train together; once both have said yes, each
learns the other's Social profile.

Until then everything stays anonymous: a request carries the same card as the board (first name and
last initial, age band, level, what you share), never a photo, a full name or a profile link. After
an accept, each side gets the other's Social profile id (people/resolve), and nothing more from here.

    send     you must pass every board check, and they must be on your board right now (otherwise
             404 not_on_board — the same answer a block gives)
    decline  silent: the sender keeps seeing "pending" until the request expires, as if unanswered
    blocks   Social's, either direction: a blocked pair is refused (404) and dropped from every list;
             when Social can't be asked, 503 blocks_unreachable (fail closed)
    limits   one live request per pair; one request to the same person per REQUEST_COOLDOWN_DAYS,
             however it ended; MAX_NEW_REQUESTS_PER_DAY; MAX_PENDING_OUTGOING

Not built yet: a plain disconnect (mutual and silent) for two people who connected and drifted
apart; today a block is the only way to end a connection.

Notifications go through Social (partner.request, partner.accepted). The request one names nobody
to Social: sending the sender as the actor would attach their profile before they are connected.
