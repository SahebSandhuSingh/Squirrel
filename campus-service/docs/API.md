# campus-service — API reference

Base URL: `https://<host>` · all routes are under `/v1` · JSON in, JSON out · snake_case keys.

**Auth.** `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` — the same RS256 token the Run Module accepts; the user id is the token's `sub`. Routes marked 🔒 require it; routes marked 👤 accept it optionally (personalised `actions` / `me` when present). Users are provisioned on first authenticated request.

**User ids.** With the Social identity bridge on (`SOCIAL_API_URL` + `SOCIAL_INTERNAL_TOKEN`), every user id this API returns (`user_id`, `owner_id`, `created_by`, `new_owner_id`, notification `data.user_id`, realtime frames, …) is the user's **Social profile id**, and `display_name` / `avatar_url` (and `hostel` when Social has one) are the Social profile's — so a tapped person opens the right Social profile. Any request field that takes a user id accepts a Social profile id (an existing campus id still works). With the bridge off, user ids are the token `sub`. See README → *Identity bridge to Social*.

**Errors.** Every error is `{ "code": "<stable_code>", "detail": "<human message>", ...extra }`. HTTP status is meaningful:

| status | codes |
|---|---|
| 401 | `unauthorized` |
| 403 | `forbidden` |
| 404 | `not_found`, `zone_inactive` |
| 409 | `already_owned`, `not_qualified`, `qualification_pending`, `unclaimed`, `own_zone`, `shielded`, `not_owner`, `not_under_attack`, `territory_conflict`, `idempotency_key_reused`, `activity_finished`, `challenge_conflict`, `crew_name_taken`, `crew_transfer_required`, `meetup_blocked`, `meetup_closed`, `meetup_participant_state` |
| 413 | `payload_too_large` |
| 422 | `invalid`, `invalid_gps` |
| 429 | `rate_limited`, `cooldown`, `defend_cooldown` (with `expires_at`) |
| 500 | `internal_error` |
| 503 | `blocks_unreachable` |

**Common shapes**

```jsonc
Person      { "user_id", "display_name", "avatar_url", "hostel" }

```

`version` on a territory is monotonic. Clients that keep local state must ignore any update whose `version` is lower than what they already hold.

## Config & health

### `GET /healthz` · `GET /readyz`
Liveness / readiness (`readyz` pings the database). `{ "ok": true }`.

### `GET /v1/config` 👤
Campus constants, feature flags, realtime URL and the active game-rule numbers. `campus.center` + `campus.max_radius_m` are the ingest area: a point farther than that from the centre fails `POST /v1/activities` with `invalid_gps` (clients drop such points before uploading).
```json
{ "campus": { "id": "iiser-kolkata", "name": "IISER Kolkata", "short_name": "IISER K", "email_domains": ["iiserkol.ac.in"], "center": [22.9637, 88.5245], "max_radius_m": 4000, "launched_at": null },
  "features": { "create_crew": true, "create_event": false, "defend": true, "open_to_meet": true, "date_mode": { "available": false, "reason": "…", "requirements": [] }, "meetup_safety_notifications": true },
  "realtime_url": "wss://…/v1/realtime", "rules": { "qualification_ttl_hours": 24, "claim_shield_hours": 2, "action_cooldown_seconds": 60 }, "auth_configured": true }
```

---

## Me & users

### `GET /v1/me` 🔒
Full own profile (public profile + `email`, `hostel_id`, `date_mode_enabled`, `onboarding_completed`, `open_to_meet_until`, `campus_xp`, `level`, `stats`, `territories`, `crews`, `recent_activities`).

### `PATCH /v1/me` 🔒
Body (all optional): `display_name`, `bio`, `avatar_url`, `connection_mode` (`date|friends|crew|null`), `hostel_id` **or** `hostel_zone_id` (a hostel zone id such as `narmada`), `onboarding_completed`, `date_mode_enabled`. Returns the same as `GET /v1/me`. 422 `invalid` on unknown hostel. The whole patch applies in one transaction: if any part is rejected nothing is written.

> **`profile_details` has moved.** Sending `profile_details` to this endpoint now returns 422 `invalid`. Private profile details (`full_name`, `personal_email`, `college_email`, `phone`, `gender`, `age`, `course`, `cgpa`) are now owned by the **Exercise service**: `PUT /api/me/profile-details`. (ADR-032 open item 1, decided.) The `user_profile_details` table still exists; the removal migration lives at `migrations/pending/007_drop_profile_details.sql` and will be applied once the production row count is confirmed 0.

### `PUT /v1/me/open-to-meet` 🔒 (aliases: `PATCH /v1/me/open-to-meet`, `PATCH /v1/users/me/open-to-meet`)
Body `{ "enabled": true, "hours": 12 }` (hours optional, default 12, max 168). Turning it on requires at least one `VERIFIED` run or walk; otherwise the API returns `409 verified_activity_required` with instructions to record and verify a run or walk first. Turning it off is always allowed. This consent gate keeps accounts with no verified activity from appearing to students. Response `{ "enabled", "updated_at", "visible_until" }`. While enabled you appear in others' *nearby* lists and can see theirs.

### `GET /v1/users/:id` 👤
Public profile: `user_id, display_name, avatar_url, hostel, bio, connection_mode, open_to_meet, verification{…}, stats{ total_distance_m, month_distance_m, zones_claimed, territories_defended, territories_stolen, crew_memberships }, territories[], crews[], badges[], joined_at, founding_member, level, campus_xp`. 404 `not_found`.

### `GET /v1/users/:id/context` 🔒
What you have in common: `{ "shared_zones": [{zone_id, zone_name, relation}], "shared_crews": [...], "shared_events": [], "icebreakers": [{id, kind, text, zone_id?, action?}] }`.

A block in either direction returns **404 `not_found`** — the same answer as a user who does not exist, so the route never reveals that a block is the reason. When Social cannot be reached the route returns an empty result with `hidden_reason: "blocks_unreachable"`; that is a different condition and may be shown.

### `POST /v1/users/:id/block` · `DELETE /v1/users/:id/block` 🔒
Create or remove a directed block; both operations are idempotent. Self-blocking returns 422.

**Blocks are owned by the Social service** (ADR-032). This service reads the caller's full block set from Social's internal API, caches it for at most 30 seconds, and unions it with its own local `blocks` table during migration. If Social cannot be reached and no fresh answer is cached, every block check **fails closed**: lists that filter people (Nearby, Active now, map players, shared zones) return empty with `hidden_reason: "blocks_unreachable"`, and actions between two people are refused with a retryable 503. The app's Block button writes to Social, not here. Running without `SOCIAL_API_URL` and `SOCIAL_INTERNAL_TOKEN` in production is refused at startup.

### `GET /v1/me/blocks` 🔒
`{ "blocks": [{ "user_id", "created_at", "person": Person|null }] }` for users the caller has blocked.

## Crews

Crews and crew membership are owned by Social. Campus endpoints that include crew information resolve it from Social; campus-service has no public `/v1/crews` routes or local crew storage.

## Meetups

`Meetup` includes `id, created_by, zone_id, zone, place_text, starts_at, status, created_at, updated_at, participants[]`. Participants include `user_id, role, status, responded_at, person`, with `open_to_meet` shown only as a hint. Status is `proposed|confirmed|cancelled|completed`; `completed` is derived at read time when a confirmed meetup's start time has passed.

### `POST /v1/meetups` 🔒
Body `{ "zone_id"?, "place_text"?, "starts_at": iso, "invitee_ids": [user-id…] }` (provide a zone or place, starts_at must be future, invitees must be distinct and cannot include the host) → `201 Meetup`. A block in either direction prevents invitation.

### `GET /v1/meetups?status=proposed|confirmed|cancelled|completed` 🔒 · `GET /v1/meetups/:id` 🔒
Return meetups the caller participates in. A non-participant or participant blocked by another participant receives 404; the list omits blocked meetups.

### `POST /v1/meetups/:id/accept` · `/decline` · `/cancel` · `/leave` 🔒
Guests accept or decline (decline has no reason field); the host is notified of response status only. The host may cancel before completion. An accepted guest may leave. A block created after invitation hides the meetup from the blocked pair and prevents acceptance.

### `GET /v1/meetups/:id/rating` 🔒
```json
{ "can_rate": true, "reason": null, "already_rated": false,
  "rateable": [Person…],
  "dimensions": [{ "key": "friendly", "label": "Friendly & Welcoming" },
                 { "key": "punctual", "label": "On Time" },
                 { "key": "fun", "label": "Fun to be around" },
                 { "key": "helpful", "label": "Helpful" }],
  "trust_score": { … } | null }
```
Only a participant of a **completed** meetup may rate, and only other participants of that meetup. A blocked pair never appears in `rateable`.

`trust_score` is **the caller's own** — never the score of the person being rated. It is an aggregate (mean stars, rounded to one decimal, with a label) and is `null` below **3 distinct raters**, the same suppression threshold the heatmap uses. Because a rater can only ever read their own score, rating someone cannot reveal the effect of that rating on the other person's score.

### `POST /v1/meetups/:id/ratings` 🔒
Body `{ "ratings": [{ "user_id", "stars": 1-5, "tags": [key…] }], "idempotency_key" }` → `{ "meetup_id", "submitted_at", "trust_score" }` — again, the caller's own score.

`tags` must be dimension keys (`friendly`, `punctual`, `fun`, `helpful`), enforced by the API **and** by a database CHECK, so a free-text tag cannot exist even if a future code path skips validation. `stars` is likewise constrained in both places. One rating per rater per ratee per meetup: the same `idempotency_key` replays, a different key for an already-rated pair is rejected. Ratings between a blocked pair are refused.

**Individual ratings and rater identities are never returned to anyone**, including the person rated. Only the aggregate is exposed, and only to its owner. Ratings are deleted with the user.

### Notifications (Social-owned)
Notifications are stored, listed, marked read, and pushed by Social. campus-service forwards campus events to Social's `POST /internal/v1/notifications`; it no longer serves `/v1/notifications` or `/v1/notifications/read`.

### `GET /v1/me/badges` 🔒 — `{ "badges": [] }` (badges are owned by the Social service — ADR-032).

---

## Zones

### `GET /v1/zones` 👤
All active zones with geometry. Query filters (combine freely): `ownedByMe=true` 🔒, `unclaimed=true`, `contested=true`, `crew=<crew uuid>`, `kind=hostel|academic|sports|food|library|landmark`, `includeInactive=true`, `format=geojson` (FeatureCollection instead of `{zones}`).
```json
{ "zones": [Zone…], "as_of": "2026-09-28T21:56:20.000Z" }
```

**Placeholder geometry.** Every seeded zone carries `geometry_source: "dev_placeholder"` — the outlines are invented and roughly placed, not surveyed. Clients should render them visibly as approximate. The seed only overwrites geometry while that marker is present, so surveyed outlines replace them permanently. See `docs/GEOGRAPHIC_DATA_REQUIRED.md`.

**Zone deletion:** A zone referenced by a meetup cannot be deleted. `meetups.zone_id` uses `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, preserving the meetup's zone association and history; deleting such a zone fails with a foreign-key error. Deactivate it instead by setting `zones.is_active = false`. The service's reads and activity verification exclude inactive zones. There is currently no API route to deactivate a zone, so an operator must make this change through database access.

### `GET /v1/zones/nearby?lat&lng&radius_m=1000` 👤
Zones whose polygon is within `radius_m` (50–10 000) of the point, nearest first, each with `distance_m` and `territory`.

### `GET /v1/zones/:id` 👤
```json
{ "zone": Zone, "territory": Territory, "actions": Actions,
  "stats": { "runs_7d", "visitors_7d", "my_visits_7d", "distance_7d_m" }, "history": [Event…] }
```
`actions` is the server's decision for the caller (all `allowed:false` with code `unauthorized` when anonymous). 404 `not_found`.

### `GET /v1/zones/:id/territory` 👤 — `{ "territory": Territory, "actions": Actions }`
### `GET /v1/zones/:id/history?limit=20` — `{ "history": [Event…] }` (max 100)

### `POST /v1/zones/:id/claim` 🔒 · `POST /v1/zones/:id/steal` 🔒 · `POST /v1/zones/:id/defend` 🔒
Body `{ "idempotency_key": "<client uuid>" }` — required. Rate limit 20/min per user.

The server re-derives eligibility inside a transaction with the zone row locked; nothing in the request other than the key is trusted. Rules:

| action | allowed when | otherwise (`code`) |
|---|---|---|
| claim | zone unclaimed **and** caller holds a live `QUALIFIED` result for the zone (verified activity, < 24 h old, unspent) | `already_owned`, `not_qualified`, `qualification_pending`, `cooldown`, `zone_inactive` |
| steal | zone owned by someone else, shield lapsed, caller qualified | `unclaimed`, `own_zone`, `shielded` (+`expires_at`), `not_qualified`, `qualification_pending`, `cooldown` |
| defend | caller is the owner (or a member of the holding crew), zone `under_challenge`, caller qualified, no defend cooldown | `not_owner`, `not_under_attack`, `not_qualified`, `defend_cooldown` (+`expires_at`), `cooldown` |

A block between two users does **not** affect stealing. Blocking a rival must not make your zones unstealable, and a refusal would tell the blocked person they are blocked.

Effects: ownership/version/shield update, a `territory_events` row, the qualification is marked `CLAIMED` (spent), XP awarded (claim 25 / steal 40 / defend 15), user cooldown starts. Defend also expires every rival's live qualification on the zone.

> ADR-032 makes the **Run Module** the single XP ledger. campus-service will report claim / steal / defend awards to it and stop keeping `campus_xp`.

Response `200`:
```json
{ "territory": Territory, "actions": Actions, "event": Event, "replayed": false }
```
Replaying the same key returns the original response with header `Idempotent-Replayed: true`. The same key with a different action/zone → 409 `idempotency_key_reused`.

Example:
```bash
curl -X POST $API/v1/zones/cc1/claim -H "Authorization: Bearer $T" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"idempotency_key":"7c1c…"}'
# 200 {"territory":{"zone_id":"cc1","owner":{"user_id":"u_aanya",…},"status":"controlled","version":2,"shield_until":"…"},"actions":{…},"event":{"action":"CLAIM",…}}
# 409 {"code":"not_qualified","detail":"Run or walk through CC1 to unlock this.","expires_at":null}
```

## Territories

### `GET /v1/territories` 👤 — `{ "territories": [Territory…], "as_of" }` — ownership of every active zone (no geometry; join with `/v1/zones` on `zone_id`). Same filters as `/v1/zones`.
### `GET /v1/territories/my` 🔒 — `{ "territories": [{ "zone": Zone, "territory": Territory, "actions": Actions }] }`
### `GET /v1/territories/contested` — owned zones that are under attack or in an active territory battle.
### `GET /v1/territories/:zoneId` — `{ "territory": Territory }`

---

## Activities (runs / walks)

An activity goes `RECORDING → PENDING → PROCESSING → VERIFIED | PARTIALLY_VERIFIED | REJECTED`. Verification is asynchronous (a worker); poll `GET /v1/activities/:id/verification` or listen for `activity.verified` on the realtime feed. Users only ever see their own activities (others' → 404).

### `POST /v1/activities` 🔒 — rate limit 50/day
Two modes:
1. **One-shot** (what the app does): include `points` (≤ 20 000) → the activity is stored and finished immediately, status `PENDING`.
2. **Streaming**: omit `points` → status `RECORDING`; then upload batches and call `/finish`.

Body: `{ "type": "run"|"walk", "started_at": iso, "ended_at"?: iso, "points"?: Point[], "client_distance_m"?, "client_duration_s"?, "device"?: {} }`
Response `201`: `{ "activity_id", "run_id", "id", "user_id", "type", "status", "started_at", "ended_at", "distance_m": null, … , "verification": { "status", "band": null, "reason": null, "verified_at": null, "app_status": "processing" } }`.
Errors: 422 `invalid` (dates), 422 `invalid_gps` (see GPS rules), 413 `payload_too_large`.

### `POST /v1/activities/:id/points` 🔒 — rate limit 60/min
Body `{ "idempotency_key"?: string, "points": Point[] }` — 1…1000 points; `seq` optional (server assigns sequentially after the last stored point). A batch whose key was already seen, or whose seq range is already fully stored, is acknowledged as `replayed:true` without changes.
Response `{ "accepted": n, "replayed": bool, "point_count": total }`. 409 `activity_finished` once finished.

### `POST /v1/activities/:id/finish` 🔒
Body (optional) `{ "ended_at"?, "client_distance_m"?, "client_duration_s"?, "device"? }` → `{ "activity_id", "status": "PENDING", "replayed": false }` and the verification job is queued. 422 if longer than 6 h.

### GPS validation rules (422 `invalid_gps`)
* lat ∈ [-90,90], lng ∈ [-180,180], finite; `accuracy_m` ≤ 100 (the app filters at 20 m before uploading)
* `recorded_at` parseable, not in the future (> 2 min), not before `started_at` (− 1 min), **non-decreasing** within and across batches; `seq` strictly increasing
* no segment faster than 30 m/s (a teleport), no two positions > 50 m apart with the same timestamp
* every point within `CAMPUS_MAX_RADIUS_M` (4 km) of the campus centre
* ≤ 1000 points per batch, ≤ 20 000 per activity, body ≤ 2 MB

### `GET /v1/activities?limit=20&cursor=<started_at>` 🔒
`{ "items": [Activity + "zones_count"], "next_cursor": iso|null }` — newest first.

### `GET /v1/activities/:id` 🔒
Activity summary with **server-derived** `distance_m`, `duration_s`, `moving_time_s`, `point_count`, plus `track` (GeoJSON LineString of the cleaned track after verification, else null). The raw anti-cheat score and signal breakdown are never returned.

### `GET /v1/activities/:id/verification` 🔒
```json
{ "activity_id", "status": "VERIFIED", "band": "accept"|"review"|"reject"|null, "reason": "Looks good. Every metre counted.", "verified_at", "app_status": "verified"|"flagged"|"rejected"|"processing", "attempts": 1 }
```

### `GET /v1/activities/:id/zones` 🔒 (alias `GET /v1/runs/:id/zones`, used by the app)
Zones the activity interacted with, from the verification pipeline, with **live** territory and actions:
```json
{ "activity_id", "run_id", "status": "verified", "verification": {…},
  "zones": [{ "zone_id": "cc1", "zone_name": "CC1", "interaction": "visited"|"looped"|"passed_through",
              "distance_in_zone_m": 812, "time_in_zone_s": 254,
              "qualification": { "status": "QUALIFIED"|"NOT_QUALIFIED"|"CLAIMED"|"EXPIRED", "metric": "coverage", "value": 0.83, "threshold": 0.6, "expires_at": iso },
              "zone": Zone, "territory": Territory, "actions": Actions }] }
```

---

## Presence — Active Now / Nearby

Exact positions are stored for distance math but **never returned**. Others see proximity buckets (`very_close` ≤ 150 m, `nearby` ≤ 500 m, `on_campus`) or grid-snapped cells (100 m).

### `PUT /v1/map/presence` 🔒 — rate limit 10/min
Body `{ "lat", "lng", "accuracy_m"? }` → `{ "accepted": true }` (or `{ accepted:false, reason:"off_campus" }`). Presence expires after 15 min.

### `GET /v1/people/active` 🔒 (aliases `GET /v1/activity/active`, `GET /v1/activity/nearby` → nearby only)
```json
{ "active_now": 7,
  "active":  [{ "person": Person+{connection_mode,bio}, "activity": { "type": "run", "started_at" }|null, "proximity": "nearby"|null }],
  "nearby":  [{ "person": …, "activity": …, "proximity": "very_close" }],
  "as_of", "visible": true, "hidden_reason": null|"open_to_meet_off"|"blocks_unreachable" }
```
* `active`: anyone on campus with a live activity. `proximity` is only filled when **both** people are open to meet.
* `nearby`: empty unless the caller is open to meet; contains only others who are open to meet and within 800 m.
* Both lists come back empty with `hidden_reason: "blocks_unreachable"` when the block set cannot be read from Social — showing nobody is correct; showing a blocked person is not.

### `GET /v1/map/players` 🔒
Grid-snapped positions (`position: [lat,lng]`, `precision_m: 100`) of people who are open to meet; empty with `hidden_reason: "open_to_meet_off"` if the caller is not, or `"blocks_unreachable"` if the block set cannot be read.

### `GET /v1/map/heatmap` 🔒
Aggregated activity intensity cells for `window=7d|30d` (default `7d`). Cells use a fixed 100 m grid and are returned only when at least 3 distinct, non-banned users have fully verified activity in the window. Response intensities are coarse `low` / `medium` / `high` buckets; exact user counts, identities, timestamps and GPS points are never returned. At most 500 cells are returned.

### `GET /v1/me/shared-zones` 🔒
Zones the caller and other people have both been active in. Verified activity only, blocked users excluded in either direction, and only people whose `open_to_meet` consent is current. Frequency is a coarse `sometimes` / `often` bucket; no timestamps, coordinates or exact counts are returned. Capped at 10 zones and 5 people per zone.

### `GET /v1/squirrel-dates/suggestions` 🔒
Returns up to 10 advisory suggestions for people already visible through shared zones. It reuses the shared-zones verified-activity, active-zone, consent-expiry, banned-user and bidirectional block filters, and preserves the shared-zones `sometimes` / `often` activity bucket. Each item contains the existing public person fields, a shared zone, the next Thursday as a date-only value, and a coarse one-hour slot. The slot is the most active campus-local hour in that zone over the last 30 days only when at least 3 distinct users were active in that hour; otherwise it uses `18:00–19:00`. Activity history contributes only to this zone-wide aggregate, never an individual's routine. Suggestions are read-only: they do not create meetups, invitations, notifications, or stored rows. Dismissals are not remembered; persistence would require a separate product and privacy decision.

### `GET /v1/map/features` 👤
A GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` of active zones for the map layer: zone geometry, `geometry_source`, and a territory summary (state and a generic owner type). Contains no owner identity, no presence and no user positions.

### `GET /v1/activity/active-count` — `{ "active_now": n, "as_of" }`

---

## Territory battles (routes: `challenges` / `challenge-invites`)

Named **territory battles** per ADR-032, to distinguish them from two other features that share the word "challenge" in the app's vocabulary but are different things owned by different services:

| name | what | owner |
|---|---|---|
| **Duels** | 1-vs-1: most verified km or most workouts in 1–30 days | Social |
| **Goals** | a target (metric, comparator, threshold, window) with an XP reward | Run Module |
| **Territory battles** | zone race, territory, weekend war — the winner decided from territory state | campus-service (this API) |

The routes and the table here keep the `challenges` name; only the documented vocabulary changes.

Types: `territory` (needs zone; user or crew), `weekend_war` (crew), `zone_race` (needs zone; user), `group_activity` (user or crew).
States: `pending → accepted → active → completed`; `pending → declined | cancelled | expired`; `accepted → cancelled`.
All routes exist under both `/v1/challenge-invites` and `/v1/challenges`.

### `GET …/types` — `{ "types": [{ id, label, description, requires_zone, targets }] }`
### `GET …?box=incoming|outgoing|all` 🔒 — `{ "invites": [Challenge…], "challenges": [same], "crew_battles_unavailable": boolean }`
```jsonc
Challenge { "id", "type", "type_label", "from": Person, "target": { "type": "user", "person": Person } | { "type": "crew", "crew": {…} },
            "zone": { id, name }|null, "starts_at", "ends_at", "message", "status", "direction": "incoming"|"outgoing",
            "created_at", "started_at", "completed_at", "result": { "winner": Person|Crew|null, "summary" }|null,
            "actions": ["accept"|"decline"|"cancel"|"schedule"|"start"|"complete"],
            "actions_status": "ready"|"crew_role_unavailable" }
```
`actions` lists the actions this caller may take now; it is also enforced by the action routes. `actions_status: "crew_role_unavailable"` means Social could not confirm crew membership, so role-dependent actions may be missing; retry after Social is reachable. This keeps the client from treating unavailable role data as a confirmed lack of permission.
Crew-targeted rows are returned only when the caller's membership is known (from a fresh or stale cached lookup); membership is never guessed during an outage. On a cold start with no cached membership, crew rows are omitted and `crew_battles_unavailable` is `true`, so the client can show a retry state without exposing another crew's challenge or message.
### `POST …` 🔒 — rate limit 20/h
Body `{ "type", "target": { "type": "user"|"crew", "id" }, "zone_id"?, "starts_at": iso, "ends_at"?: iso, "message"? }` → `201 Challenge`. 422 on bad combos (self-challenge, missing zone, past start), 404 unknown target/zone, 409 `challenge_conflict` if an open challenge already exists for the same target+zone. A block in either direction prevents creating one, and fails closed (503 `blocks_unreachable`) when the block set cannot be read.
### `PATCH …/:id/schedule` 🔒 — creator only while `pending|accepted`; body `{ "starts_at", "ends_at"? }`.
### `POST …/:id/accept` · `/decline` 🔒 — invited side only (crew: owner/admin). 403 otherwise, 409 unless `pending`.
### `POST …/:id/cancel` 🔒 — creator only; `pending|accepted`.
### `POST …/:id/start` 🔒 — any participant; `accepted` and within 15 min of `starts_at` (accepted challenges also auto-activate at `starts_at`).
### `POST …/:id/complete` 🔒 — any participant; `active` and past `ends_at`. **The winner is decided by the server** from territory state (`territory`/`zone_race`: whoever holds the zone; `weekend_war`: crew zone counts). Body is ignored.

Every transition emits `challenge.created|updated` (and app alias `invite.updated`) to all participants and a notification to the other side.

## Leaderboards & stats

### `GET /v1/leaderboards/squirrels?period=daily|weekly|alltime&limit=10&metric=xp|zones|distance` 👤
`{ "period", "metric", "entries": [{ user_id, display_name, avatar_url, hostel, xp, zones_claimed, distance_m, rank }], "me": entry|null, "updated_at" }`. XP for `daily/weekly` is XP earned in the window; `alltime` uses lifetime campus XP. Cached 30 s.

### `GET /v1/leaderboards/hostels?period=` 👤
`{ "entries": [{ hostel_id, name, territories, active_members, distance_m, xp, score, rank }], "my_hostel_id" }`. `score = territories×100 + xp + distance_m/100 + active_members×5`.

> ADR-032: a board belongs to the owner of the number it ranks. The "zones held" boards are this service's; XP boards move to the Run Module's ledger once campus XP is reported there.

### `GET /v1/campus/stats` (app) — users_total, users_active_now, zones_total, zones_claimed, crews_total, zones_claimed_today, territory_changes_today, activities_today, active_squirrels_today, challenges_today, challenges_open, meetups_today, founding_spots_left (null). `crews_total` comes from Social, is cached for 60 seconds, and uses the last known count during a Social outage (zero before the first successful lookup).
### `GET /v1/stats/daily` (spec) — `{ date, active_squirrels, zones_claimed_today, crews, activities, territory_changes, meetups, challenges, users_active_now }`.

## Realtime — `GET /v1/realtime` (WebSocket)

```jsonc
→ { "type": "auth", "token": "<jwt>" }                      // optional; unlocks private topics
→ { "type": "subscribe", "topics": ["territories","stats","invites","activities","active","notifications"] }
→ { "type": "ping" }
← { "type": "auth.ok" | "auth.error" | "subscribed" | "pong", "data": … }
← { "type": "<event>", "data": … }
```
Default topics: `territories`, `stats`, `active`. Private events are only delivered to the users they concern.

| event | topic | data | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `territory.claimed` / `territory.stolen` / `territory.defended` | territories | Territory | each also emits `territory.updated` (app alias) |
| `territory.contested` | territories | `{ zone_id, under_challenge: true }` | a rival became eligible while unshielded |
| `territory.released` | territories | Territory | reserved for future decay/release |
| `zone.updated` | territories | Zone | zone metadata/geometry changed |
| `challenge.created` / `challenge.updated` | invites (private) | Challenge | also `invite.updated` |
| `activity.verified` | activities (private) | `{ activity_id, status, app_status, zones:[{zone_id, qualified}] }` | |
| `active.updated` | active | `{ active_now }` | |
| `stats.updated` | stats | reserved | |
| `notification.created` | notifications (private) | notification item | |

Events fan out across API instances via Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY`; a page that misses events should simply refetch on focus.

## Notification catalogue (forwarded to Social)

`territory.stolen` (to previous owner) · `territory.challenged` (to owner when a rival qualifies on an unshielded zone) · `territory.defended` (to repelled attackers) · `zone.claimed` (to crew mates) · `challenge.invitation` · `challenge.updated` · `meetup.invited` · `meetup.accepted` · `meetup.declined` (status only) · `meetup.cancelled` · `activity.verification_complete` · reserved: `challenge.reminder`, `event.reminder`, `meetup.check_in`.

Social resolves `{actor}` and anonymizes it when the actor is unknown or either person has blocked the other. campus-service publishes `notification.created` only after Social returns a non-null notification id, and that id matches Social's list entry.

## Rate limits
Global 300 req/min per user (or IP when anonymous). Ownership writes 20/min. Point batches 60/min. Activity creation 50/day. Presence 10/min. Challenge creation 20/h. Exceeding → 429 `rate_limited`.
