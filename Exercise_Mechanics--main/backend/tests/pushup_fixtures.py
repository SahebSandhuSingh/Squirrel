"""Synthetic SIDE-ON push-up frames for the push-up rule and adapter tests.

Not a test module (no ``test_`` prefix, so pytest does not collect it) — it is the shared body model
the push-up tests drive, in the same spirit as the per-file keypoint builders the squat, curl and
high-knee tests use, factored out because five test modules need the same geometry.

THE MODEL. A person in profile, hands planted on the floor, body a rigid straight line pivoting about
the ankles. Coordinates are pixels with y growing downward, exactly as the browser sends them.

    * ``progress`` drives the elbow: the arm is two equal segments from shoulder to wrist, so a
      target elbow angle fixes the shoulder-to-wrist distance (d = 2 L sin(theta/2)) and the shoulder
      descends toward the fixed hands as the elbow bends. progress 0.0 is the captured top
      (``BASELINE_ELBOW_DEG``), progress 1.0 is ``TARGET_ELBOW_DEG`` — matching the template.
    * The hip is placed ON the shoulder-to-ankle line, so a default frame has a perfectly straight
      body. ``sag`` displaces it perpendicular to that line: positive toward the floor (sag),
      negative away (pike), in units of the body span — the same scale the rule reports.
    * ``lateral`` is how far the far-side landmarks sit from the near-side ones in x. Small is the
      side-on view being modelled; large simulates a user who has turned to face the camera.
