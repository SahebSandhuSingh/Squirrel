"""Wire constants shared with the mobile clients (mirrored in mobile/nearby/*).

BLE layout (see mobile/nearby/README.md):
    • Advertisement: the Squirrel SERVICE_UUID only. iOS cannot advertise service/manufacturer data,
      so no identifier is ever placed in the advertisement itself.
    • GATT: SERVICE_UUID exposes one read-only characteristic, BLE_ID_CHARACTERISTIC_UUID, whose value
      is `[PAYLOAD_VERSION][16-byte rotating BLE id]`. No pairing / bonding.
