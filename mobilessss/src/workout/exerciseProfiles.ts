/**
 * Camera requirements per exercise, in one place: which joints must be in the picture for the
 * coach to work, which are only nice to have, and how the body is oriented.
 *
 * `essential` mirrors each exercise's server setup (Exercise_Mechanics--main/backend/workouts/
 * <slug>/configs/setup.yaml `keypoints`): the server starts a set only when every one of them is
 * tracked at visibility ≥ 0.5, so the app asks the person to adjust exactly when the server would
 * refuse, and never otherwise. Rep counting (thresholds, hysteresis, timings) is configured per
 * exercise on the server (configs/fsm.yaml, templates.yaml); nothing here counts reps.
 *
 * Adding an exercise: add its profile here and its configs on the server.
