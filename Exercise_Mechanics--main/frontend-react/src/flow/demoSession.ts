/* demoSession.ts — provisioning for the demo-first entry (see App.tsx DEMO_PUSHUP).

   workout builder. A demo has already made all three of those decisions, so this makes them
   non-interactively and produces exactly what the Solo builder produces: a persisted session id
   and the normalized WorkoutConfig the coach runs on. Nothing downstream is stubbed — the same
   setup gate, baseline capture, rules and scoring run afterwards.
