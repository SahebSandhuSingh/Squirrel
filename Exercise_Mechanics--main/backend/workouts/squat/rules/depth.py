"""Depth rule — the squat's range-of-motion signal + full/shallow gate.

This is one biomechanical rule kernel (template id `depth`, "Short depth"), built to stand
completely on its own — no rep FSM, no phase machine, no rep counting. It answers two
questions from a single frame's hip + knee landmarks:

    1. HOW DEEP is the squat right now?      → a normalized `depth_ratio` signal
    2. Is that deep enough for a FULL rep?    → the `is_full_depth()` gate

Division of responsibility (why this is FSM-free):
    • This rule owns WHAT "full depth" means (one gate) and how depth is measured.
    • A rep machine (built separately) owns WHEN — it tracks each rep's PEAK depth and asks
      this rule `is_full_depth(peak)`. A rep is flagged SHALLOW when that is False.
    So the shallow/partial-rep verdict is a trivial function of this rule's gate applied to a
    peak — the rule provides the brain, the FSM provides the timing. Nothing here needs to
    know about setup/descent/bottom/ascent/reset.

The measurement (the load-bearing part):

    depth_ratio = (hip_mid_y − baseline_hip_y) / (baseline_knee_y − baseline_hip_y)

        0.0  = standing (hip at its baseline height)
        1.0  = the hip has descended to the STANDING knee height (≈ parallel)
        >1.0 = deeper than parallel (hip below the standing knee line)
        <0.0 = hip rose above standing (e.g. onto toes) — kept raw, not clamped

    Image y grows downward, so a descending hip means an INCREASING hip_mid_y. Because the
    signal is a ratio of two pixel spans it is invariant to body size and camera distance.
    The denominator (standing hip→knee span) is taken from the BASELINE, not the live frame:
    the live knee drifts forward and is noisy mid-squat, so the fixed standing knee is the
    stable reference. `hip_below_knee` (hip vs LIVE knee) is a separate ATG indicator, kept
    purely informational — it drives nothing.

For squat (an FSM-1 / descend-first movement) `depth_ratio` doubles as the rep machine's
progress signal (0 at rest → grows to a peak at the bottom). A different exercise would
supply its own signal kernel; this one stays squat-specific but FSM-agnostic.

Thresholds are NOT hardcoded here. ``full_rom_gate`` is passed verbatim from the squat template
and is the sole credit boundary; depth deliberately has no hysteresis.
