"""The matching view: what activity matching may know about a member.

Coarse and consented only: first name and last initial, age (shown as a band), fitness level,
declared activities with their interest scores, and preferred workout times only when habits consent
is also granted. Never gender, body data, contact details or location.

Unreadable data fails closed: a member whose consent log can't be read counts as not opted in, so
nobody is shown on the strength of a consent that can't be confirmed.
