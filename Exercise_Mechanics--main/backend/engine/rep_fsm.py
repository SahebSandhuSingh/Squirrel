"""Exercise-agnostic repetition taxonomy and phase state machine.

The machine consumes one normalized movement-progress signal: the resting position is near zero
and progress grows toward the peak of the rep (squat depth, elbow flexion, …). Biomechanics remain
in the exercise's signal kernel. This module owns only movement history, attempt qualification and
full-versus-shallow classification.

One configuration-supplied predicate is the full-ROM authority. The same predicate controls both
entry into the peak phase and the completed-rep verdict. ``min_rep_peak`` is a lower qualification
boundary: rep-shaped movements below it are diagnostic invalid attempts and never advance the set.

Phase names are not fixed here. The lifecycle roles (the resting/``setup`` phase, the ``reset``
dwell phase, the movement phases and which movement phase is the returning one) are derived from
the configured transition graph, so a descend-first squat and an ascend-first curl share this exact
machine with different phase vocabularies.

Tracking-unavailable frames pause the machine. A short gap can resume only when the recovered
progress is compatible with the prior phase. A long or incompatible gap discards the partial
movement and requires a fresh resting setup frame. Stale time can also discard a movement, but it
never fabricates a completed rep.

    A single-signal exercise (squat depth) can describe a frame with one number, and

    full ROM only when BOTH arms reach the gate, but has returned to rest only when BOTH arms are
    down. Those are opposite reductions of the same pair — ``min`` on the way up, ``max`` on the way
    back — so no single scalar can carry both, and an exercise that tried would end its reps as soon
    as the FIRST limb came down.

    Each fact therefore arrives already decided by the exercise, which is the only layer that knows
    what its limbs mean. ``progress`` remains one number because peak tracking, classification and
    scoring are inherently scalar: it is the movement's own headline value (the weaker arm, for a
    curl), not a re-derivation of the booleans.
