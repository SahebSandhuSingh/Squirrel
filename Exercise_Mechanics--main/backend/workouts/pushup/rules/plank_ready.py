"""Push-up pre-check — the baseline may only be captured at the top of a real push-up.

The analogue of squat's `standing_posture`: a setup-only condition that decides whether a captured
frame is fit to become this person's reference. It is the one push-up rule that measures in ABSOLUTE
terms, and that is deliberate — the live rules are baseline-relative, so if a sagging or
half-bent-arm plank were accepted here, every later reading would be measured against a bad zero.

Three checks, all from one frame:

    arms_extended    the elbow is at least `min_elbow_extension_deg` — the top of a push-up, so the
                     captured elbow angle can serve as push-up depth's zero point.
    body_straight    |hip offset from the shoulder-to-ankle line| within `max_body_line_offset`, on
                     the same normalized scale the live body-line rule uses.
    torso_horizontal the shoulder-to-hip line is within `max_torso_deg_from_horizontal` of the image
                     horizontal. In a plank the torso is near-horizontal; this is also what separates
                     a push-up from a standing exercise, and it is the only check here that would
                     reject somebody setting up for the wrong movement entirely.

Ported from the standalone service, where the same three quantities formed the push-up classifier's
signals (pose_backend/exercises/pushup.py: torso_horizontal, body_line_straightish) — here they are a
setup gate rather than a classifier, because in Exercise Mechanics the app already knows which
exercise the user selected.
